# Skin-Cancer-Detection
This basic project uses a Convolutional Neural Network and sequential model to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant. Features: Uses basic sequential model, Trained on Kaggle MNIST Skin Cancer Dataset(/kaggle/input/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) , Built with Tensorflow and keras. 
It is our most basic project upon which we are currently working to improve more. We are planning to use pre-trained models to increase accuracy and enhance our model more.
